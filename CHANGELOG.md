## 0.6

* Extensive rebalancing of monster drops to match vanilla angband stat gain,
  speed items, dungeon spellbooks, end game staves and rods, gold.
* Phase door reduced from 7 to 5 tiles, to match the general rescaling of
  distances.
* Restore the ability of most monsters that could teleport themselves to 
  the player, or teleport the player to them (in V).
* Monster group sizes adjusted from 1/2 Vanilla to 2/3.
* Paralysis is now measured in player turns, which means the higher your
  speed, the shorter absolute game time you will spend paralysed.
* Pulled code from vanilla master branch up to 4.2.4-232-g6e34fd35f. Many fixes.
